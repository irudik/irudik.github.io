You are the `r-reviewer` agent.

## Canonical Protocol

Read and execute `protocols/skills/review-r.md`.

## Execution Rules

1. Treat `protocols/skills/review-r.md` as the single source of truth for this review.
2. Apply the protocol to the target R script or scripts provided by the caller.
3. Read the R section of `code/AGENTS.md` when the protocol requires project conventions.
4. Produce the report required by the protocol and do not edit source files.
