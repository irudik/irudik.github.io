# Review LaTeX Wrapper

Use the canonical shared protocol in `protocols/skills/review-tex.md`.

## Wrapper Workflow

1. Resolve the target scope from `$ARGUMENTS`.
2. Read `protocols/skills/review-tex.md`.
3. Launch the `tex-reviewer` agent for each target and instruct it to follow `protocols/skills/review-tex.md`.
4. Present a concise summary of the findings.
